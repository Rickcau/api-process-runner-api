This soluton is designed to parse a series of CSV files that are extracted from various systems.  These files are then processed for various Fraud patterns and the results are written to disk.  Ideally, the data would be pulled directly from the DataBase, but in this example the custom only had access to the the data in CSV files.  This same scenario could be applied to any system to help detect Fraud.
